# Features
1. Husky :: Forcibly runs linter and comprehensive test battery prior to `git commit` and `git push`.
2. Jest :: Recursively searches for all test files (and testable files) and compiles details on uncovered code in a coverage report. Supports a live interactive test mode, and allows for running specific tests on the fly during development.
3. Prettier :: Recursively searches for all source and test files to lint.
4. TypeScript :: ES6, but with types (!), and more. Supports backwards compatibility to JavaScript, and transpilation to ES5 using Babel.
